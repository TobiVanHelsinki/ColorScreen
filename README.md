# Why
You have a multi-monitor-windows-setup? üñ•Ô∏èüíªüñ•Ô∏è 
Turning off some monitors while watching a movie on one screen is not cool enough? Then this UWP App is the right one for you! It displays pure black (or any other color) at full screen! (yes, it does not do more)

# How
start it, do right click for color-choosing and left-click to toggle full screen.

# Install
this is quite hard, as Microsoft has removed the sideloading for this old apps. However, there is a MS Store Version.

# State of development
TBH, not good. This is pure-fun project and after MS let the UWP dying ‚ò†Ô∏è, I have little to no interest in continuing this work. besides that, disabling a screen by hardware buttons saves more power. üå≤

# Why - but in the first place
Back then I had a Surface Book and two external displays. Whenever I disable them, windows got totally confused and it was a mess.
